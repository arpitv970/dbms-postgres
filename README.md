# About Project
This project is developed soley for learning purpose of mine for exploring `RDBMS` databases & `SQL` which could be very useful to me in various ways, especially while contributing to **Open-Source** projects such as *Cal.com*.

## Main focus of this project
- Get comfortable with `SQL` to access **DB**.
- Working with `PostgresSQL`.
- Integrate `PostgresSQL` in simpler projects using `Node.js` + `Express.js` as **backend frameworks** (*Next.js*)
- Able to contribute to nice **Open-Source** projects!

# TODO's
- Create Docker Environment to setup Postgres upon
    - [ ] Create new Docker Network `dbms-network`
    - [ ] Pull docker image of `Postgres`
    - [ ] SetUp `PGAdmin` for *GUI* of DB
